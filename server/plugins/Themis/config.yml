# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Welcome to the Themis configuration file!
#
# This config file was generated from Themis version 0.10.0
# --> if you're using a newer version of Themis you should check the changelog to see if your config needs to be updated.
# If you want to update your config file, you can either change it manually, or rename this file which will lead to a new
# up to date one being generated on the next server restart.
#
# Important: This configuration file allows you to change every single setting for each check individually for maximum
# flexibility. Often however you'll want to use the same values for most of the checks. Because of this, there is the
# "default" section, which defines the default values for all checks, and these can then be overwritten in the check
# specific sections below.
# For example if you wanted to disable the tickrate check, you could overwrite the "enable" setting by adding it like this:
# ----------
# tickrate:             <-- this should already be in the config, remove the {} at the end if it's still there
#   enable: false       <-- this is what you add
# ----------
#
# All values are either booleans (true / false) or doubles (1.0, 2.5, -123.456, ...).
# All time values are in seconds.
#
# If you have any questions, problems, or just generally want to stay up to date, you can join the Themis Discord:
# https://discord.gg/jjkR2EU
# However before asking questions first please read everything here carefully, this only takes a few minutes and will answer
# lots of questions. We are happy to help you on the Discord, but we often get the same questions over and over again even
# though they are already answered here.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# These are the default values which are used for all checks that don't explicitly overwrite them below
default:

  # Should the check be enabled?
  enable: true

  # Should Themis block hacks (e.g. by dragging players back)?
  block: true
  # At which score should Themis start blocking the hacks?
  block-threshold: 10.0

  # Themis allows you to configure actions which can each run a list of arbitrary commands. You can specify exactly when
  # an action should be run. Refer to the notify action below for a detailed example:
  actions:
    # What is the name of the action? This name needs to be unique.
    notify:
      # What is the minimum score for Themis to run this action?
      execution-threshold: 10.0
      # Which amount of new violations need to happen for this action to be repeated?
      repetition-threshold: 5.0
      # Which amount of time needs to pass for this action to be repeated?
      repetition-delay: 10.0
      # Which commands should be run? You can specify as many as you'd like which will be run in the order they're listed.
      # Currently you can use the following placeholders: %player_name%, %detection_type%, %score%, %ping%, %tps%
      commands:
        - "themis notify §c§lSUS §b§lAntiCheat §r§8> §7%player_name% failed %detection_type% §6(x%score%) §8| §7from: movementChecks, ping: %ping%, tps: %tps%"

  # Until which maximum ping should Themis check players? Themis will not check player who have a higher ping than this.
  # Warning: Hacked clients can fake a high ping, use this setting with caution!
  # Set to -1.0 to always check
  max-ping: -1.0

  # Until which minimum TPS should Themis perform checks? Themis will not check any players when the server's TPS are below this value
  # Set to -1.0 to always check
  min-tps: 13.0

  # After which amount of time should violations expire?
  # Set this to -1.0 to disable this feature and store violations until the server is restarted
  violation-expiration: 900.0

# Note: It is totally fine if the sections below are empty. Please refer to the third paragraph at the top of the
# configuration for the explanation. The {} marks it as an empty section, you need to remove when adding settings.

# This checks movement while flying with an Elytra
# Ingame name: Elytra Flight
# Hacks that can trigger this: Elytra+, Extra Elytra, ...

# This check detects if a client is speeding up the time, which means it can e.g. move faster.
